# help

The package *help* helps you get the content of your help files into a list.

Install with:

``` r
remotes::install.github("moodymudskiper/help")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
# equivalent calls :
# doc(base::mean)
# doc(mean, "base")
# doc("mean", "base")
help::doc(mean)
```

Note that the output has been simplified from the `\\code{...}` etc that are
found in the help files, to get the raw version set simplify to `FALSE`.
